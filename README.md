Project built for a hackathon: Celo x Huobi: Stablecoin in Web3 & Sustainability

This project allows users to buy a token by Dollar-Cost Averaging. They can choose an input token, an input amount, a frequency and an output token and a bot will execute the swaps over time.

For example, a user can choose to buy CELO with 100 cUSD in weekly 10 cUSD increments.
